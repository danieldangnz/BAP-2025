First Meeting with Craig McDonald - the EIT Timetable Coordinator.
Craig will act as your client for this project, where you’ll be developing applications to assist him in collecting data from EIT to generate timetables.
Craig discussed the current tools he uses — Syllabus Plus and TIGRS (access forms) — and mentioned his interest in replacing the TIGRS access forms with Excel-based applications for data collection.
