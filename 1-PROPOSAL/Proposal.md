# Proposal

## Executive Summary


## Introduction
The Eastern Institute of Technology is an educational instution based in Hawke's Bay, but with campuses all over New Zealand. 
Craig McDonald, the EIT Timetable Coordinator, has expressed their interest in updating the way EIT collects data across all EIT campuses to generate timetables.
This project aims to support Craig and their goal of improving the way EIT gathers timetable-related data.

This project will ultimately support Craig and EIT in generating more accurate and timely timetables through better data collection tools and practices.

## Problem Statement
EIT uses Syllabus+, a software solution designed for educational institutions to manage timetabling, scheduling, and resource allocation. 
This is supplemented with data collected from Micrsoft Access forms known as TIGrS (Timetable Information Gathering System). 
Craig would like to replace the TIGrS Access forms with a Microsoft Excel-based solution. 
The goal of this project is to design and develop Excel-based applications to replicate and improve on the current functionality of the TIGrS forms.

Currently, there are 36 Access-based TIGrS forms used to collect timetable data throughout all EIT Campuses (Taradale, TairƒÅwhiti, Auckland Hastings...). 
Craig would like to streamline this into three Excel-based forms - Programs, Courses and Activities. 
Each form has their own set of requirements of what information needs to be collected. 
These forms will need to replicate the functionality of the current Access-based forms, while also enhancing their usability and reducing any administrative burdens.

## Solution Overview
From this document, the proposed solution will help to streamline timetable creation for resource allocation and setting timeslots alongside making the application functional outside of windows machines.
Craig will be able to use information gathered from lecturers to create a timetable for the semester, Lecturers will be able to use this to give Craig the relevant information.

## Requirements Analysis
Craig has asked us to shift a Microsoft Access database into a more accessible Excel database as some systems can't use Access, most notably Mac machines.


## Techincal Approach
### Frontend
This application will be developed in Visual Basic, both querying databases and form creation will be handled through this language.

### Database structuring
Database tables will be stored within sheets in the backend of the forms within Excel.

### Deployment
The final result will have a single excel document with essentially no access into the backend. This can be copied and shared to relevant colleagues

## Risks and Assumptions
Potential for systems not native to Microsoft not allowing Visual Basic to work as intended.
