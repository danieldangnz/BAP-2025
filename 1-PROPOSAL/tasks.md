# Assigning tasks
To assign a task, raise an issue within the repository. Usually this feature wouldn't be used like this, but in our case it would work fine for task assignment

Creating an issue will send an email to any users assigned

For example if I wanted to assign myself and Jayden to fix a bug that was causing something to break, but I couldn't figure it out on my own, I can add myself and Jayden to work on the issue
