Proposal

Executive Summary


Introduction
The Eastern Institute of Technology is an educational instution based in Hawke's Bay, but with campuses all over New Zealand. Craig McDonald, the EIT Timetable Coordinator, has expressed their interest in updating the way EIT collects data across all EIT
campuses to generate timetables. This project aims to support Craig and their goal of improving the way EIT gathers timetable-related data.

EIT use Syllabus+, a software solution designed for educational institutions to manage timetabling, scheduling, and resource allocation. This is supplemented with data collected from Micrsoft Access forms known as TIGrS (Timetable Information Gathering System). Craig would like to replace the TIGrS Access forms with a Microsoft Excel-based solution. The goal of this project is to design and develop Excel-based applications to replicate and improve on the current functionality of the TIGrS forms.

Currently, there are 36 Access-based TIGrS forms used to collect timetable data throughout all EIT Campuses (Taradale, TairƒÅwhiti, Auckland Hastings...). Craig would like to streamline this into three Excel-based forms - Programs, Courses and Activities. Each form has their own set of requirements of what information needs to be collected. These forms will need to replicate the functionality of the current Access-based forms, while also enhancing their usability and reducing any administrative burdens.

This project will ultimately support Craig and EIT in generating more accurate and timely timetables through better data collection tools and practices.
