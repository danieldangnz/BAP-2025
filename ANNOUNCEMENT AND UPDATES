Here are a few important updates:

1. Weekly Class Schedule (Updated):
•	Monday: 10:00 AM – 12:00 PM, Room C320.
•	Tuesday: 1:00 PM – 3:00 PM, Room C113.

2. Data Collection Files:
Craig has sent James two key files—an Excel spreadsheet and an Access form—used for collecting data to build the EIT timetable. 
James has uploaded both files to our shared GitHub repository in the “2-Design” folder.
Your task this week is to study and understand these files as a baseline. Please note down any questions or unclear points so you can raise them with Craig during next week’s meeting.

3. Proposal Document Wring Tasks:
Please assign tasks among yourselves to begin drafting the Proposal document. 
Once tasks are assigned, upload the breakdown to GitHub so we can track progress effectively.
